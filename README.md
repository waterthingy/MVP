## Tech Specs - first thoughts
1.  QR Code Management System
    - Each QR code is unique or campaign-specific
    - QR points to a short URL hosted on your server (e.g., yourbrand.com/xyz123)
    - These short URLs are stored in a database and linked to advertiser metadata
2. Stack Suggestion:
    - Backend: Node.js / Django / Flask / Laravel
    - Frontend: React / Next.js / Svelte (if web dashboard is needed)
    - Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB
    - QR Generator: Use libraries like qrcode (Node) or pyqrcode (Python)
3. Redirection + Analytics Layer
    - When QR is scanned:
    - User hits your URL
    - Backend checks campaign rules
    - Optionally presents a reward/collectible/cashback page
    - Logs data (time, IP, location if needed)
    - Redirects to advertiser's site
4. Optional Middleware:
    - Redis for caching popular links
    - Firebase or Segment for analytics
5. Reward System (Gamification)
    - Digital Collectibles (NFT-style assets, even without blockchain)
    - Display a digital asset: image, video, animation
    - Store claim logs (user + collectible + timestamp)
    - Cashbacks/Vouchers
6. Integration with wallet/payment gateway (e.g., Razorpay, Paytm, or gift card APIs)
    - Could be instant or after an action (like visiting site)
    - Stack:
    - Store collectible metadata in DB or use IPFS if you go blockchain route
    - Issue logic: per scan, per day, or chance-based (like gacha/lottery)
7. Dashboard for Advertisers
    - Login + campaign creation
    - Upload destination URL, content type (cashback, collectible, etc.)
    - Real-time stats (scans, geos, device types, etc.)
8. Stack Suggestion:
    - Admin UI: React + Tailwind + Charting (Recharts or Chart.js)
    - Auth: Firebase Auth, Auth0, or your own JWT logic
